Ensures that players have the same mods as the server.

This mod has to be installed on the client and the server.
This mod sends a list of installed mods to the server. The server then checks if the mods and mod versions match.
If this isn't the case it kicks the player with a message that shows the missing mods or mismatching versions.
If the client hasn't installed this mod at all, the server kicks the client after a specific amount of time when not sending the mod list to the server.
